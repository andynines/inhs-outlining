TODOS FOR THIS WEEK
Fish-card intersection issues:
    Fish 44303
    And 51445
    Maybe 44665
    Maye 78620 (look at this one first!)
    Definitely 8266 (good example too along with 44303)
    Definitely 51500 too, that's another good example
    54074 is also a problem but not because of the tag; rather because it has an untucked fin.
        I guess this is no different from fish who are missing parts of their fins, and we tolerate those.
    64281 has problems with some structure near the fish that isn't a card.
Comparing my areas with Joel's to see if I could be wrong?
Try feat reduction on lda feats?
Make a confusion matrix, per-class accuracy
Stratify probability of each top-1 pick. Record accuracy just when confidence is > 95% for ex.
Weighted average of shapes is possible. Maybe do an animation?
Find precision/recall/f1 of classifier
Try using a neural network (not just a perceptron, but try that too) for classification.
If you move back the starting point of the pipeline (filling the database with og images rather than cropped ones) parameterize the padding and use 10% instead of an absolute 10px.
Start writing final report
Find a target journal/event
variance pca, does first 30 of 95% = 60%?
cosine similarity between efds?

NOTES ON THESIS PAPER
Why outlines (specimen features) are important, in the context of fish
Phenotypical traits (vs. genotypical)
Exploring variation among species (an artificial label) and when something deserves to be called a new species
Measuring an outline manually as a domain expert is not feasible. Computational approaches unlock a new realm of possibilities
explain progression form Breen features -> Fourier Descriptors
and progression of outline extraction techniques
The outline is one of many features
Example scientific questions that we could answer with these
The why: trait extraction is a major problem in itself for BGNN, and we need outlines along with many other traits.
Fourier analysis provides DISCRIMINATING features
Need to round up whole data curation process somewhere. Your spring week 2 report sort of does it but the details of what got dropped for detectron reasons might be wrong; look back farther in your presentations. And we now also dropped Lepomis Hybrids and loners

STILL-RELEVANT NOTES ON BGNN PRESENTATION
Include the coverage of my dataset and how I arrived at those particular fish. How many species, genuses, etc.? See Spring Week 2 report for info.
Include lots of visuals
Slide ideas: motivations (on Yasin's wishlist), scientific/biological questions regarding comparison of species, shapes, changes over time, geography, phenotypical analysis. Also CS-related interest

GENERAL AREAS TO LOOK INTO IF TIME PERMITS
Alignment comparisons
Hierarchical clustering (see Titan lake paper)
Projections from centroids
Dynamic time warp analysis of signals. Signals align, fall apart from each other, and then align again There's a package called python-dtw for it.
"Antennae" of catfish create weird components of outline that don't fit the fish well; see 42539 for example.
Improve outlining by looking at the gradient of the saturation histogram. Maybe the location of the largest difference is the best threshold? Also take into account distance from the bottom mean.
Modify the contour error metric by using an "interpolating Hausdorff distance"
Using other shape descriptors to add to each outline's feature vector (see https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d3/dc0/group__imgproc__shape.html)
Pull in image quality metrics generated by Leipzig et. al. to determine whether we should use an image
Make my own length calculation and compare it to Joel's from his OG paper
SVD as a dim reduction method?
Reach out to the  Ecological and Evolutionary Signal-processing and Informatics Laboratory in the ECE dept.
Data augmentation ideas: 1. random-weight averages of a random number of samples 2. random perturbations of a single sample
Do another outlining hyperparameter search. Figuring out how to do this in a reasonable amount of time is the hard part.

METHODS/DETAILS WE ARE DECIDEDLY NOT INTERESTED IN
Zahn-Roskies shape functions
Eigenshapes
Outlining using edge detection. We just can't seem to get a closed contour using Canny and the like.
Adapting this pipeline to other image repositories; I just don't have the time, but someone else might.

GENERAL INTERESTING THINGS TO REMEMBER
The curse of dimensionality - as dimensions increase, everything becomes equidistant! Especially when the number of samples is less than the number of features.
Ground truth errors? automated methods to detect them
Voronoi diagrams
Wavelet fourier descriptors? Just something I've read
Landmarks? What defines one?
Discontinuities in curvature, e.g. the tip of a shark's back fin, could help us compute the potentially feature of distance between extremal points / landmarks
Remember to properly cite all libraries used, like PyEFD and Sklearn and Python-DTW
A nearest centroid classifier actually did a lot better (75% acc) than a KNN (50% acc) out of the box.
When you normalize EFDs, the first three coefficients will always be 1, 0, 0. So you can remove them from a feature matrix.
Most high-harmonic fish do genuinely need that many to reconstruct within tolerance. But several are actually screwed up.
There are the feature efds and the working efds. In order to maximize distinguishability, we may have to make irreversible transformations/normalizations to the efds that don't allow us to reconstruct their outlines.

OLD BRAINSTORM ARTIFACTS FROM OUTLINE EXTRACTION DISCUSSIONS

Alternatively, a level set evolution with a velocity proportional to distances?
As a boundary pixel, look at your non-boundary, non-interior neighbors. "exterior", background pixel
If this distance is below a certain threshold, then the exterior pixel becomes the new boundary
A more iterative process based on an initial guess
Oh, and we'd also want to look at interior neighbors because you could be over-segmenting

To compute curvature on a chain code, hit it with a gaussian filter to blur it, turn it into grayscale, and then compute iso line curvatures on that grayscale image using preexisting formulas
What's the right spatial resolution where there's distinguishing qualities of the fish's curvature?

1. extracting outline
2. computing curvature -> initial "signal" that we could use
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.7340.pdf
https://math.mit.edu/classes/18.086/2007/levelsetnotes.pdf

key phrase: level set method / level set curvature
equation 4 in his given paper to compute curvatures of gaussian-blurred version of jagged binary image

We have the segmentation boundary so at any point we know in what general direction "out" is

Notion of uniform tension of a string wrapped around the fish
Breen looked into something like it a long time ago (see paper) but probably over-complex
