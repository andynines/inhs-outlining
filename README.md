# INHS Fish Outlining

![Example fish outline](example.png)

## Setup
### 1.
Ensure you have the latest version of `fish.db`. I've reached my free Git LFS quota, so the copy included here may be old. The latest version has this SHA1 hash:
```
$ sha1sum fish.db
7a047498773f207c17fbecf0d63fbd9365f973b5  fish.db
```
If your version differs, please download the latest:
```
wget http://andrewsenin.com/fish.db
```
### 2.
Create a __Python 3__ virtual environment in the top level of the repository:
```
$ python -m venv venv/
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Reproducing presentation results
### 1.
Generate the dataset. This shouldn't take more than one half hour on an average processor:
```
python datagen.py
```
This produces the following dataset files in the current directory:
* `1mm_fifteen_species.csv`
* `1mm_seven_genera.csv`
* `1mm_aug_seven_genera.csv`

### 2.
Run the classification experiment by loading your desired dataset in `classification.ipynb` and running all the cells.

## Querying and viewing fish
See `outlining_demo.ipynb` for usage examples.
