# INHS Fish Outlining

![Example fish outline](example.png)

## Setup
### 1.
Ensure you have the latest version of `fish.db`. I've reached my free Git LFS quota, so the copy included here may be old. The latest version has this SHA1 hash:
```
$ sha1sum fish.db
7a047498773f207c17fbecf0d63fbd9365f973b5  fish.db
```
If your version differs, please download the latest:
```
wget http://andrewsenin.com/fish.db
```
### 2.
Create a __Python 3__ virtual environment in the top level of the repository:
```
$ python setup.py
```
This will create a virtual environment and install project dependencies into the environment.

### 3.
Activate the environment for your session.
```
$ source venv/bin/activate # venv\Scripts\activate.bat for Windows ... source venv/Scripts/activate for a bash emulator
```

## Reproducing presentation results
### 1.
Generate the dataset. This takes less than ten minutes on eight, Intel i5 cores at 3.4 GHz:
```
python datagen.py
```
This produces the file `1mm_fifteen_species.csv`.
### 2.
Run the classification experiment:
```
python classif.py
```
You may observe higher accuracy than I reported during the presentation. I've since begun normalizing the elliptic Fourier descriptors' scale, which gives a slight accuracy boost.

## General usage examples
I frequently work in interactive sessions:
```
$ python -i inhs_outlining.py 
```
You can fetch particular fish in a few different ways:
```python
>>> one_boops = Fish.example_of("Notropis", "Boops")
>>> all_cyanelluses = Fish.all_of_species("Lepomis", "Cyanellus")
>>> fish_5099 = Fish.with_id("5099")
```
Then, you can view their outlines using their `show_reconstruction()` method.

You may also refer to the [outlining demo notebook](outlining_demo.ipynb).

## Outstanding issues
* Morphing animations between fish (not shown in the presentation) are a work in progress. The function `animate_morph_between()` in `inhs_outlining.py` produces a GIF, but it's choppy.
* There are several fish that are close enough to other objects in the image for their outlines to connect. I have a fix but haven't implemented it yet. Fish 44303 is one example.
